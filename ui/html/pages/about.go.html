<p>
    Github Analyzer is a simple web application that allows you to query a Github repository and view the results.
    This application was built with the help of <a href="https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/">Alex Edward's Let's Go</a> as an exercise to get more familiar with Go Backend development.
